## Process

A process is instance of running program.
to see all the running program or all the running process we have use the `ps` command

```terminal
root@3fa853fb44ac:~# ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
      1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
     28 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
root@3fa853fb44ac:~#
```

- here we have two process on is running `bash` and other is running `ps`
- technically `ps` is very short live process it only exist that while `ps` this command producing output
- so here only running bash,
- bash means borning cell,its the program that we are interacting with , here
- program that take our command and sends them to linux for execution

- Each process have unique identifier `PID` that is generated by operating system

```terminal
root@d1859157eb86:~# ps
 PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  19 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
root@d1859157eb86:~#
```

- What is `TTY` short for teletype, and here we type of terminal the user logged into
- `pts` is short for pseudo terminal - `pts/0` means first terminal window, so i open other terminal window and start this container and then execute the same command we see `pts/1`
- so in this `pts/0` column we can see which terminal the user is logged into
- now this ` 00:00:00` time is amount of `CPU` time each process consume. So both this process are very light weight and not taking much of cpu time
- but some you notice your is slow, thats bcs some process taking so much CPU time.In that you have to kill that process
